# Array Assignment

Create a program that will construct an array of your choice dynamically. This means initializing an array `type variable[size];`  then assigning each index a value, like `variable[0] = 100`.

## Requirements

+ It cannot be the same program as the solution
+ It uses a for loop for `cout`ing the elements 
+ The array is of size 5 or larger
+ Reading from user input is optional

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
-(1) Ask a programming buddy
-(2) Run the solution program
-(3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
-(4) Ask a student leader
-(5) Look at the solution program

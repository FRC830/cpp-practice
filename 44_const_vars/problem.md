# Constant Variables

[Bucky's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55CRqm1gzk&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83&index=44)

The `const` key word stands for constant and when it is used on variables, it means that the variable can't be changed later in the code once it is set.

```cpp

    const int x = 5;
    x = 3;
    cout << x << endl;

    //This program would throw an error.

```

Create a program that will set a boolean called `isAlive` constantly true and then in `main()`, cout `"I am immortal"` after testing isAlive in a conditional.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
-(1) Ask a programming buddy
-(2) Run the solution program
-(3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
-(4) Ask a student leader
-(5) Look at the solution program

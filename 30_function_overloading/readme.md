# Function overloading

Up to this point all functions could only accept 1 data type. In c++, we can "overload" a function to  get it to work with multiple types.

Create a program with a function  `whatType` that accepts one int parameter and outputs:
"I am printing a int"
Then, overload the function to accept Strings, and output  "I am  printing a string"
Finally, test both functions on a string and int.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
- (1) Ask a programming buddy
- (2) Run the solution program
- (3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
- (4) Ask a student leader
- (5) Look at the solution program

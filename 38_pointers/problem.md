# Pointers intro

I hate pointers, and I'm not very good at explaining them. [Here is a video that made sense to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-HBipu_1P0)

Follow the steps of the video and do these things:

+ create a variable called `a` and assign it to an int
+ output the address of `a`(&)
+ create a pointer named `aPointer`
+ assign the new pointer `aPointer` as a reference (&) to `a`
+ output `aPointer`
+ using the defereference syntax, change the value of `a` to another number (*)
+ output the value of `a`

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
- (1) Ask a programming buddy
- (2) Run the solution program
- (3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
- (4) Ask a student leader
- (5) Look at the solution program

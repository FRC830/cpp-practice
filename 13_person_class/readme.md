# Classes with variables

The person class. [Buckys Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTS7JTud1qQ)

Create a class similar to animal with 2 methods:

- `getName`, which returns one string
- `setName`, which accepts one string parameter

Also create a private variable `name`.

The functions `getName` will return the string `name`, and `setName` will change the `name` to the parameter passed in.

Then, in the main function
- create an instance of the class
- set the name to your name (`setName`)
- output the result of `getName` to cout.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
- (1) Ask a programming buddy
- (2) Run the solution program
- (3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
- (4) Ask a student leader
- (5) Look at the solution program

# Classes with constructors

[Buckys video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b7odUc7lg0)

Add a constructor to the `Person` class that accepts one parameter `initialName`.

Then, call `setName` with the parameter inside the constructor.

Create 2 instances of the `Person` class and give them different names by initializing them. (This calls the constructor).

Output both of their names.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
-(1) Ask a programming buddy
-(2) Run the solution program
-(3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
-(4) Ask a student leader
-(5) Look at the solution program

# Assignment and Increment Operators

This is going to be a playground for a bunch of new operators. [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0kEDZ-tuNw)

For each type of calculation, have one expression using it on a variable x. Then output x.

- `*=`
- `/=`
- `-=`
- `+=`
- `%=`


Then this part can be confusing, just remember that :
+ `x++` increments the value of variable x after processing the current statement.
+ `++x` increments the value of variable x before processing the current statement.

Try out these:

- `x++`
- `++x`
- `x--` 
- `--x`

We are also not going to `return 0;` at the end of main anymore, as it is just a formality from old-style c++ programming.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
- (1) Ask a programming buddy
- (2) Run the solution program
- (3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
- (4) Ask a student leader
- (5) Look at the solution program

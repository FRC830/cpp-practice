# Intro to arrays

+ Create an int array with the first 5 perfect square numbers.
+ Ask the user which # perfect square they would like to see.
+ Output the nth perfect square *hint: arrays start at zero*

The format for defining an array is as such:

```cpp
type variable[size] = {ITEM1, ITEM2, etc}
```

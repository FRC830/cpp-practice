# If else (with a twist)

Create a function `is_greater`, that accepts two parameters, `num1` and `num2`.

Have this function return "greater", "equal", or "less" depending on their relationship.

Then, output the result of this function.

requirements:

- The `is_greater` function returns a string.
- The `is_greater` function uses an if, else if, and else expression.
- The `is_greater` function accepts two numbers
- The two numbers are read from the user(input) into variables with different names than the function parameters.

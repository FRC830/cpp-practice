[Buckys video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLKhsaOPnLk)

- Create a variable `bacon` with value `0`.
- Create a while loop that checks if `bacon` is less than or equal to `20`.
- Inside the while loop, output the value of `bacon`
- Then, increase the value of bacon inside the while loop.
- BONUS: what happens if you never increase the value of bacon?

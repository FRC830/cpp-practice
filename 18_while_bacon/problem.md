# Intro to while loops

[Buckys video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLKhsaOPnLk)

- Create a variable `bacon` with value `0`.
- Create a while loop that checks if `bacon` is less than or equal to `20`.
- Inside the while loop, output the value of `bacon`
- Then, increase the value of bacon inside the while loop.
- BONUS: what happens if you never increase the value of bacon?

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
- (1) Ask a programming buddy
- (2) Run the solution program
- (3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
- (4) Ask a student leader
- (5) Look at the solution program

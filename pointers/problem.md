# Pointers intro

I hate pointers, and I'm not very good at explaining them. [Here is a video that made sense to me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-HBipu_1P0)

Follow the steps of the video and do these things:

+ create a variable a and assign it to an int
+ output a pointer (&) to a
+ create a pointer named `aPointer`
+ assign the new pointer `aPointer` as a reference (&) to a
+ output `aPointer`
+ using the defereference syntax, change the value of a to another number (*)
+ output the value of `a`

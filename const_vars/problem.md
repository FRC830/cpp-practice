# Constant Variables

[Bucky's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k55CRqm1gzk&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83&index=44)

The `const` key word stands for constant and when it is used on variables, it means that the variable can't be changed later in the code once it is set.

```cpp

    const int x = 5;
    x = 3;
    cout << x << endl;

    //This program would throw an error.

```

Create a program that will set a boolean called "isAlive" constantly true and then in main(), cout "I am immortal" after testing isAlive in a conditional.

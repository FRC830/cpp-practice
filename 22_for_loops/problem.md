# For loops

[Buckys video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBO8yvyyBI0)

For loops are broken up into three parts:

- Initial value
- Ending expression
- Increment expression

Here is an example of these three

```cpp
int x = 10;
x < 50;
x += 5;
```

A for loop runs based on these three conditions like so:

```cpp
for (int x= 10; x < 50; x+=5) {
    cout << x << "\n";
}
```

Create your own for loop and output a value inside of it.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
-(1) Ask a programming buddy
-(2) Run the solution program
-(3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
-(4) Ask a student leader
-(5) Look at the solution program

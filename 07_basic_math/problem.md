# Basic Math

Create a program that outputs the following

- `20 + 10`
- `10 - 50`
- `5 / 2`
- `99 * 98`
- `10 % 3`

Requirements:

- Use only *1* variable, and store the result of each calculation in this variable.

As for all lessons, if you're having trouble:
- (1) Ask a programming buddy
- (2) Run the solution program
- (3) Watch Bucky's video on the topic
- (4) Ask a student leader
- (5) Look at the solution program
